Buffon's Needle Problem was first proposed by Georges Buffon in 1737. By randomly throwing needles onto a hard floor marked with equally spaced lines, Buffon was able to derive a mathematial expression which could be used to calculate the value of $\pi$. Specifically, the probability that a needle of length equal to the width of parallel boards overlaps with a board edge is $\frac{2}{\pi}$. 

One can estimate pi by dropping a large number of pins and using the ratio of overlaps to non-overlaps to estimate pi.
The accuracy of this experimental value of pi increases with an increasing number of random throws. 
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle) for a detailed problem description and background.

# Buffon's Needles Problem

In this assignment, you will develop an algorithm that estimates $\pi$ based on the above description, and write a program to implement this  algorithm.

1. Your algorithm will be implemented in Julia.
2. Your main function will have the following signature: `buffon(n::Int)`.
3. Your main function will return $\hat{\pi}$, your estimate for pi.
4. You will plot how your algorithm converges as the sample count is increased using [Plots.jl](https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl)
5. Although you may discuss your algorithm with others, you must not share code.

## Milestone One: Implementing `buffon(n::Int)`

Our goal is to implement a function, `buffon(n::Int)`. The function `buffon(n::Int)` takes in an integer parameter `n` as the number of trials run, returning an estimate for pi based on the number of trials. We can divide the implementation of the function `buffon(n::Int)` into three parts: 
1. Throwing a needle
2. Checking whether the needle overlaps with a floorboard line
3. Use your result to estimate ${\pi}$

### Part 1: Throwing a Needle

To throw a needle, we can keep track of where it lands and how it lands. To do so, choose random x to specify the location of the center of the needle (the y location does not matter - make sure that makes sense to you before moving on) and an angle $\theta$ to specify in what orientation the needle lies once it lands. Since we are simulating throws, choose random values for x and $\theta$. The `rand()` function selects a random number between 0 and 1.

### Part 2: Determine Overlap

After you have implemented a means of throwing a needle, you will need to decide whether or not it overlaps with a board edge. Think about the coordinate system we defined for our floor. You will want to make use of conditionals such as if statements. (Think about which condition you really need to check within the if statement)

### Part 3: Estimating $\pi$

It is now time to use the two function we wrote the get an estimate for $\pi$! Recall that Buffon's Needles Problem tells us that the ratio of overlaps to nonoverlaps is $\frac{2}{\pi}$. Once that you are able to run the specified number of trials, you have an estimate for $\frac{2}{\pi}$ and with some algebra we can then get an estimate for ${\pi}$.

## Milestone Two: Create a convergence plot

Now that you have the algorithm for estimating pi with the help of Buffon‚Äôs Needles Problem, we will use it to create a convergence plot for our data. The x-axis of the plot will be the number of samples and we will generate 15 different sample sizes using log space from 1 to 10,000 samples, which is given by: 

	nsamples = round.(Int, collect(exp10.(range(1, stop=5, length=15))))
                    
The y-axis will be the estimated value of $\pi$ we get from various sample sizes. 
 
We will then plot the mean estimate for $\pi$ for each of 100 trials of the 15 different sample sizes. Also be sure to include error bars with 1-standard deviation.

### Run Trials, Calculate Mean, and Find Standard Deviation 

First, we need to run the 100 trials for each of the 15 sample sizes. We want to store the results in some data structure -- a useful data structure might be an array. This all depends on how you would want to calculate the mean estimate for ${\pi}$ for each of the 15 sample sizes. 

Now that you have your data stored in some structure, you will need to calculate the mean estimate for the mean estimate for ${\pi}$ for each of the 15 sample sizes. There are many ways to do this depending on how you initialized your structure. 

Finally, you will need to find the error. You could use the `std` function in Julia to find the standard deviation, ${\sigma}$ for each of the 15 sample sizes. You would then need to divide by the square root of the sample size to calculate error. So for each sample size you would need to calculate $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, where ${\sigma}$ is the standard devation for that sample and $n$ is the size of that sample.

**Useful functions:**

`mean` (pass in an array of values)

`std` (pass in an array of values)
